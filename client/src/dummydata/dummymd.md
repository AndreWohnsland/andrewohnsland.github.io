# This is just a test to Check

Lets see how react will render this markdown.

Therefore we will use different types, take this list of fruits

- Apple
- Peach
- Banana

I have no clue why this three but it's okay.

Let's see how code looks like:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("somedata.csv")
df.head()
df.plot(kind="bar")
```

Thanks to the awesome React Syntax Highlighter The code section looks super nice!

And some `variables`, just for display.

And maybe a table:

| 1               | 2        | 3         |
| --------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Hello           | my       | friends   |
| This is         | kinda    | useless   |
| But still shows | how it's | displayed |

## looks like we got some text boss

Good lets keep it like this for now

### What will happen

When the backend with the rest / GraphQl endpoint and the MongoDB will be there the blogs will be fetched from there

But currently they lay around as dummydata. A man can only do as much as he can ;)
