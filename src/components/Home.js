            Welcome to my little humble homepage. It's nothing big, but it gets better over time as I get better with
            React and other frameworks. Have a look around, get a glimpse what I do and maybe have a look in some of my
            projects{' '}
            <span role='img' aria-label='smile'>
              ðŸ˜ƒ
            </span>
            . If you want to dive deeper, you can also have a look into my Github!
          </p>
